# Graph Visualization and Algorithm Execution with D3.js

## Description
This project is an interactive graph visualization tool built with TypeScript and D3.js. It allows users to create and manipulate graph data structures, as well as perform and visualize several algorithms on them.

## Features
- Modify graph structures in real-time (drag nodes, delete edges, update weights, and more)
- Display self-looping edges and curved edges for bidirectional links in directed graphs
- Visualize the execution of the most important graph algorithms

## Supported Algorithms
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Topological Sort
- Strongly Connected Components
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford's Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
